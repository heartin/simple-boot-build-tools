# Simple Starter Build Tools

This project will contain all resources required for build (e.g. checkstyle xml). 

This project needs to be extracted to a folder (buildtools) within the build folder of your project. 
This is currently done by the starter parent projects' pom (e.g. simple-starter-parent-java). 

## Usage and setup (Local machine)

1. Clone simple-starter-build-tools: <br>
git clone https://github.com/heartin/simple-starter-build-tools.git
1. Run './mvnw clean install' or 'mvn clean install'
